# 📈 Canva Social Referral Traffic Analysis

_A quick, exploratory data project demonstrating how targeted data analysis can uncover growth opportunities._

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This notebook provides a brief analysis of Canva's estimated web traffic sources (May 2025) to identify patterns in social media referrals and propose ways to improve conversion rates from these channels.

The goal is to **showcase practical data analytics skills** applied to a realistic, business-relevant problem.

---

## 🗺️ **Business Context**

Canva is a global leader in online design. While its direct and organic traffic are strong, publicly available estimates suggest social media referrals are comparatively low.

Improving conversion from social channels can support user growth goals, especially given the rise of short-form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

## 📊 **Data Source**

- [Similarweb – Canva.com Traffic Overview](https://www.similarweb.com/website/canva.com/)

All data used here are **public estimates**. No proprietary or internal Canva data were accessed.

---

## 🧭 **Methodology**

1. Collected estimated monthly traffic share by channel (Direct, Organic Search, Social).
2. Simulated realistic visit numbers based on published Similarweb totals (~844M in May 2025).
3. Visualised traffic source breakdown.
4. Analyzed conversion rate differences (hypothetical but realistic scenario).
5. Proposed a simple test to improve social referral conversion.

---

## 📈 **Key Findings**

- Direct traffic accounts for ~69% of visits, reflecting strong brand loyalty.
- Organic Search contributes ~27%.
- Social Media referrals are ~3.6%, but have room to grow given market trends.

**Hypothesis:** Social visitors may experience lower landing page relevance, reducing conversion rates.

---

## 💡 **Recommendation**

> **Test a personalised landing page variant for social referrals.**
>
> - Tailor messaging and CTAs for short-form video audiences.
> - Reduce friction and bounce rates.
> - Aim for even a 1–2% uplift in conversion (potentially thousands of incremental sign-ups per month).
