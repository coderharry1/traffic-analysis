# 📈 Canva Social Referral Traffic Analysis

_A quick, business-focused data exploration demonstrating how targeted analytics can uncover actionable growth opportunities._

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This notebook provides a concise analysis of Canva's estimated web traffic sources (May 2025) to identify patterns in social media referrals and propose ways to improve conversion rates from these channels.

The goal is to **showcase practical data analytics skills** applied to a realistic, business-relevant question.

---

## 🗺️ Business Context

Canva is a global leader in online design tools. While its direct and organic traffic are very strong, public estimates suggest social media referrals are relatively low.

Improving conversion from social channels could support Canva’s user growth, especially with the rise of short-form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

## 🧭 Methodology

- Collected estimated traffic share by channel (Direct, Organic Search, Social).
- Simulated realistic visit numbers based on published totals (~844M in May 2025).
- Visualised traffic source breakdown.
- Explored conversion rate differences (hypothetical but realistic scenario).
- Proposed a simple A/B test idea to improve social referral conversion.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Direct traffic accounts for ~69% of visits, showing strong brand loyalty.
- Organic Search contributes ~27%, reflecting solid SEO.
- Social Media referrals are ~3.6%, suggesting room to grow given social platform trends.

**Hypothesis:** Social visitors may experience lower landing page relevance, reducing conversion rates compared to other channels.

## 💡 Recommendation

**Test a personalised landing page variant for social referrals.**

- Tailor messaging and CTAs for short-form video audiences.
- Reduce bounce rates and friction.
- Even a modest 1–2% uplift in conversion could translate to thousands of incremental sign-ups monthly.
